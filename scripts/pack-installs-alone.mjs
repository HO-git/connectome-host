// Packs connectome-host as `npm publish` packs it, installs the tarball
// alone into an empty directory with its dependencies from the registry, as
// `npm install @animalabs/connectome-host` does with the npm on PATH, and
// runs it there under bun. That npm must run a dependency's install scripts,
// as npm 10 and 11 do, so the postinstall builds the Web UI: npm 12 and bun skip
// them by default, so their installs have no Web UI, and under npm 12 this
// check fails at its Web UI step. It checks:
//   1. the Web UI built: dist/web/index.html is in the installed package;
//   2. `bun build` resolves src/index.ts's static imports, and its dynamic
//      ones with a literal specifier, in the installed tree, on paths a run
//      doesn't reach too (a recipe extension, loaded by a computed path, isn't
//      among them);
//   3. @opentui/core loads with its native package for this platform, which
//      it imports by a computed path that `bun build` can't follow;
//   4. the README's offline smoke run, recipes/mock-test.json in batch mode,
//      with the Web UI off and membrane's mock adapter replying from a queue,
//      so no credentials and no provider call. It must exit 0, taking the
//      message it was sent and then printing the queued reply, which carries
//      a nonce of this run.
// A file missing from the package, or a dependency only devDependencies
// supplied, then fails here, before the release is published, and not for
// whoever installs it. The publish workflow runs it in a job of its own,
// without the publish credential, since install scripts run here; to check
// by hand, run it from the repository root, for example before
// `git push --follow-tags`. npm pack packs the working tree, so it warns when
// that differs from HEAD, where the publish workflow packs a clean checkout.
// A failed install is tried again, three attempts in all,
// PACK_INSTALLS_ALONE_RETRY_DELAY_MS apart (default 15000), to get past a
// registry blip; one that runs out of time isn't.
// PACK_INSTALLS_ALONE_INSTALL_TIMEOUT_MS and
// PACK_INSTALLS_ALONE_SMOKE_TIMEOUT_MS set the install's and the smoke run's
// limits in milliseconds (defaults 900000 and 120000).
